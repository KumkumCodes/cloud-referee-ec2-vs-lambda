# Cloud Referee: AWS EC2 vs AWS Lambda

## Problem
Developers often ask “Which AWS service should I use?” but receive single answers that hide trade-offs.

## Solution
This tool acts as a neutral referee. It compares EC2 and Lambda based on user constraints and explains trade-offs instead of recommending one service.

## How It Works
- Accepts workload constraints
- Scores each service
- Explains why each option fits or fails

## Kiro Usage
Kiro accelerated development by:
- Generating comparison prompts
- Structuring trade-off explanations
- Speeding up rule-based logic design

## Example Output
Shows when EC2 is better and when Lambda is better based on constraints.
